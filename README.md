# Kalbe Data Science Virtual Internship

Welcome to the Kalbe Data Science Virtual Internship repository! This repository showcases the completed tasks for the internship, demonstrating the skills and expertise acquired throughout the program.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the internship, I successfully performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Here are some of the powerful questions we answered through our analysis:

1. **EDA Question 1: Marital Status Impact** - Uncovered the average age of customers based on their marital status, providing valuable insights into the relationship between age and marital status.
2. **EDA Question 2: Gender Analysis** - Explored the average age of customers based on their gender, enabling us to understand potential age-related patterns among different genders.
3. **EDA Question 3: Store Performance** - Identified the store with the highest total quantity, revealing the most successful store in terms of product sales.
4. **EDA Question 4: Best-Selling Product** - Determined the best-selling product with the highest total amount, shedding light on the most popular item among customers.

## Predictive Modeling and Clustering

Our internship journey also involved predictive modeling using regression and clustering techniques. Here are the highlights of our achievements:

### Machine Learning Regression (Time Series)

I excelled in building a robust machine learning regression model, specifically designed for time series data. Our approach included the following steps:

- **Data Cleansing** - Employed rigorous data cleaning techniques to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- **Data Merging** - Consolidated multiple datasets into a unified dataset for analysis and modeling.
- **Regression Modeling** - Developed a powerful regression model capable of predicting the daily total quantity of products sold.
- **Data Aggregation** - Grouped the data by date, aggregating the quantity column to create a new dataset suitable for regression analysis.
- **ARIMA Method** - Leveraged the ARIMA time series method to forecast future sales quantities with precision.

### Machine Learning Clustering

In addition to regression, I tackled the challenge of customer clustering using machine learning techniques. Here's an overview of our approach:

- **Data Cleansing** - Ensured data cleanliness and consistency through meticulous data cleansing procedures.
- **Data Merging** - Integrated various datasets into a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis.
- **Clustering Model Creation** - Constructed an effective machine learning clustering model to group similar customers based on their characteristics.
- **Data Aggregation** - Grouped the data by customerID, aggregating relevant columns such as transaction ID count, quantity sum, and total amount sum.
- **KMeans Method** - Employed the powerful KMeans clustering method to identify distinct customer groups based on their shared characteristics.

Through these challenging tasks, I demonstrated our expertise in data analysis, machine learning regression, and clustering techniques, showcasing our ability to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
